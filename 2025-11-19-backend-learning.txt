OJT Backend Developer Learning – 19th November 2025

1. Understanding Backend in Web Development
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (browser side).

Backend: Server-side languages like Python, Java, Node.js; supports website functionality with databases, frameworks, web servers.

Technology Choice: Based on project requirements and developer preferences.

2. Popular Backend Languages
JavaScript (Node.js):

High-level, versatile, for both client and server (Node.js).

Rich ecosystem (React, Angular, Vue).

Go (Golang):

Google’s simple, compiled language, fast and concurrent (goroutines).

Good for microservices and web servers.

Python:

Simple, readable, many libraries (Django, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow).

Popular for web, data science, ML, scripting.

3. Version Control System (VCS)
Manages and tracks code changes.

Enables collaboration, rollback, and history.

Centralized: e.g., Subversion.

Distributed: e.g., Git, Mercurial.

4. Git
Distributed VCS by Linus Torvalds (2005).

Efficient code tracking, branching, merging, supports offline work.

5. Repository Hosting Services
Platforms to store/version code, collaborate, manage branches/issues, CI/CD.

Examples: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.

6. GitHub
Microsoft’s web-based Git platform.

Supports repos, pull requests, code review, social coding.

Central hub for open-source and team dev.

7. Relational Database
Data in tables (rows/columns). Uses SQL; supports transactions, constraints.

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

Good for structured data & consistency.

8. API (Application Programming Interface)
Rules for software communication (endpoints, HTTP methods like GET, POST).

Standardized data formats (JSON, XML).

9. REST API
Uses HTTP for stateless CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Relies on URI, status codes, often JSON/XML.

10. Caching
Stores data for fast access, reduces latency/server load.

Implemented at browser, app, DB level (LRU, time-based).

11. CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration (CI): Automates merge/testing of code, detects bugs, reduces manual testing.

Continuous Delivery (CD): Automates deployment to staging/testing; manual release to production.

Continuous Deployment: Fully automated deployment to production after passing tests.

Key Benefits: Faster releases, better quality, less risk.
